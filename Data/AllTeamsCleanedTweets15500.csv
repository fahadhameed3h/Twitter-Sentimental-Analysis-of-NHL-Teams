TonyG If we don‚Äôt beat Anaheim we‚Äôre sadly not playoff material anyway We should beat them though This Ducks team doesn‚Äôt look like they can score If they had Dylan Strome he would be leading their team in goals and points üòÄ
This is a good one To be fair we expected Tampa to be very good maybe not THIS good but very good nonetheless and Ottawa to be bad Nobody could have expected the Anaheim Ducks‚Äô leading scorer to only have 39 points including players traded away on February 27th
As a Ducks fan can t wait to see him in Anaheim next year But until then I really hope him and the Gulls can win a Calder Cup first

Five thoughts from the second period of Bruins Sharks with the B s opening up a lead on San Jose 4 1
The San Jose Sharks have to be amongst the biggest if not the biggest chokers in North American sports the last 20 years consistently a top 2 3 team in the West amp every year they blow it classic soft Pacific division team
The San Jose Sharks Bruins game is insane There has been multiple fights Evander Kane got a game misconduct and 67 penalty minutes
Nifty 16 San Jose Sharks Thugs
this is not a banner night for the san jose sharks
Jesus Christ it was a blatant headshot Take the yellow glasses off after the refs fucked the Sharks in San Jose last time
I didn‚Äôt realize how many goons were on the San Jose Sharks
I just witnessed a 6 foot 9 Slovakian man murder a gentleman from San Jose via Vancouver at the TD Garden Send help stop the fight the San Jose Sharks have families for God‚Äôs sake
Boston Bruins Captain needs to be suspended firva blow to San Jose Sharks Kane head
I was thinking San Jose may change goalies to jump start the third but Martin Jones is the reason why the haven t scored 10 goals already
Boston is 22 1 3 when leading after 2 periods this season while San Jose is 4 13 3 when trailing after 2
after 2 periods 4 1 Boston has outshot San Jose 24 12 8 4 B s in the 2nd amp outscored them 3 0 in the 2nd on goals by amp That was easily 1 of their best frames of the season
After 40 minutes the lead the San Jose Sharks 4 1 and it honestly could be worse The Bruins are firing on all cylinders and are using stout defense to create transitional offense going the other way Shots 24 12 in favor of the home side
How badly does San Jose want to go home amp be done with this game road trip Haha they re even giving up great scoring chances on the PP luckily it was a shorthanded breakaway by Nordstrom that was predictably stopped by Jones
Y know the refs suck but San Jose is doing NOTHING to help their case No push back Not skating Lazy back passes that turn into breakaways Sharks need to get back to business
Let s all laugh at San Jose Sharks üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Reception at San Jose Diridon train station major station right near the SAP center where the SJ Sharks nhl team plays is terrible Very slow Lots of disconnects This is a high traffic area that deserves better
Boston is 11 5 5 this season when they are tied after 1 period while San Jose is 11 6 4 when they are knotted after 1
Coming into tonight San Jose had won 7 of their last 8 road games They also lead the NHL in goals per game 4 0 since Dec 1 2018 amp they have the most 20 goal scorers 5
after 1 period 1 1 Boston outshot San Jose 16 8 Couture scored a PPG to open things for the Sharks then Krejci answered with a PPG of his own shortly after that
The have quietly outplayed San Jose through the first 20 minutes despite the scoring tied 1 1 Boston leads 16 8 in shots and has a had a pep in its step from the jump Couture s odd goal is the only bright spot for the Sharks
It s a moot point now 1 1 but San Jose is 26 4 5 when they score 1st this season while Boston is 12 12 4 when they allow the 1st goal
Boston is 21 7 3 this season while San Jose wrapping up a 4 game road trip tonight is 13 13 3 on the road
A weird power play goal gives San Jose a 1 0 lead at 12 47 a loose puck by Halak at the side of the net just kinda slid in Couture gets credited for it his 23rd goal of the season unassisted
