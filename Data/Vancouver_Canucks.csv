"@PuckSoupPodcast @wyshynski I know people outside Vancouver don't get it, but Messier was a complete abomination during his time with the Canucks. It's not that he left us in the lurch so much as his time here involved him actively undermining and destabilizing the team in favour of his ego &amp; ice time",Kavinay Kishor,2019-02-28 14:44:07
