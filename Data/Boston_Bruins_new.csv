@ben_delbick @OddsShark @SDubs35 Boston has owned the Leafs in recent playoffs and I expect that to continue this season. The problem for the Bruins starts in round 2 if they have to face the Lightning on the road. They can definitely beat them but I  don‚Äôt know how much they‚Äôll have left after that series.,kingsfansince71,2019-03-06 15:39:50
"@DonLagreca fun fact the Boston bruins are 13-0-4 in their last 17 games. In that time they‚Äôve gained a grand total of zero points on Tampa in that time. They‚Äôre the same distance back as when they started their streak.
